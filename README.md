# Match Game

## Overview

The Match Game is an interactive application that presents users with a series of images, each accompanied by a description. The interface integrates a scoring system for positive and negative feedback, allowing users to express their sentiments towards each displayed item.

## Features

- **Top Menu**: Displays scores for the user's reactions. It highlights a positive and a negative score, providing immediate feedback on user responses.

- **Center Display**: Showcases an image alongside its description, occupying a central position for prominent visibility.

- **Bottom Menu**: Contains two buttons - 'True' and 'False', which enable users to navigate through the items while registering their feedback. Additionally, there's a 'Back' button, allowing users to return to the home page and view game instructions.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: On selecting an option from the bottom menu ('True' or 'False'), the application transitions to the next image while simultaneously updating the respective score in the top menu.

- **React Router**: Seamlessly navigate through different sections of the app with the integrated React Router.
